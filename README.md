Brain Activity to Voice Converter

A prototype brainâ€“computer interface (BCI) that translates EEG signals into reliable yes/no vocal responses. This project was developed to improve communication options for non-verbal users.

Features

Signal Processing Pipeline

Data acquisition via Arduino

Filtering and artifact removal

Time & frequency domain feature extraction

Machine Learning

Neural network models built with PyTorch

Cross-validation & class-weighting to handle imbalanced data

Achieved ~70% accuracy on held-out test data

Visualization & Analysis

Tools built with Matplotlib to interpret model behaviour

Assisted in feature engineering and iteration cycles

Tech Stack

Hardware: Arduino, EEG headset

Languages & Tools: Python, PyTorch, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Methodologies: Neural networks, signal processing, cross-validation
